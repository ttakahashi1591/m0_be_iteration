# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
    - The `each` method could be useful to filter out a certain part of a data set just as the example we did where we pulled out any elements with 3 letters from the `words` array. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
    - Again this lesson was not terribly difficult but I did catch myslef needing to look up what code is necessary to figure out the square root of the Intergers in a given a given array as well as how to pull of the elements with 3 letters from the `words` array. 
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
    - Taking the time to research how to compelte the problems that involed more than just adding the iteration to an interpolated sentence. This really presents how powerful Ruby can be and what the code can do to manipulate a data set to pull waht you need.
